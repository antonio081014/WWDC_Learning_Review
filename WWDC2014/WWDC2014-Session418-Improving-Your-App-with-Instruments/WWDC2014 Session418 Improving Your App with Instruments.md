In this session, presenters presents what's new in instruments, few technics for memory management, capture list in swift to avoid retain strong reference cycle, and Time Profiling.

## Why use Time Profiling?
- Faster app launch times
- Kepp frame rate at 60fps
- Buttery-smooth scrolling
- Responsive UI

## What is Time Profiling?
Samples stack trace information at prescribed intervals, providing an idea of how much time each method takes.

## When use Time Profiler?
- Frame rate slowdowns
- Some part of your app takes too long

**Keep an eye on CPU usage in Xcode**

- Threads strategy
  - Enable Record Waiting Threads to expose blocked threads

#### Ignore unwanted data
- Charge moves the associated cost
- Prune removes the associated cost
- Focus is "Prune everything but"

NOTE: did't finish the 3rd part focusing on **Performance Counter**
