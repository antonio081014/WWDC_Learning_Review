# WWDC2016 Session 301 Introducing Expanded Subscriptions in iTunes Connect

## Roadmap

### What is an In-App Purchase
Digital content or service bought within app
- Consumable
- Non-consumable
- Non-renewable subscriptions
- Auto-renewable subscriptions

### Auto-Renewable Subscriptions

#### Increased proceeds
Proceeds goes from 70% to 85% for subscriptions over a year.

#### Subscription Groups
Only one of subscription in a single group could be selected, if the app needs to support multiple subscriptions to be active at the same time, then multiple subscritpion groups should be created.

In the same group, the level of subscription could be offered for the different subscription, thus, user could upgrade/downgrde subscription level.


#### Territory Pricing
Price could be customized for each territory.

#### Customer Retention
Using _Push Notification_ and highly customized _Email_ would be a good idea to keep attracting exisiting customers.

#### Preserve Price
Multiple ways to manipulate the prices.
- Initial price could be offered for the soft launch (Early adopters).
- A different price could be offered after trial period.
- Increase the price without changing exisiting customers, afater a certain date.
- Increase the price without changing early adopters price, after a certain date.
- Early adopters price could also be changed. (That will be effective immediately.)
