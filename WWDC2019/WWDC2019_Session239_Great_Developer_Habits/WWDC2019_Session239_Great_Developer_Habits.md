# Great Developer Habits

### Organize
1. Functional organization with groups
2. Mirror project structure and file structure
3. Break apart large storyboards
4. Modernize your project file
5. Throw away code scraps
6. Address the root cause of warnings

### Track (Source Control)
1. Use source control (git)
2. Keep commits small and isolated
3. Write useful commit messages (What I was thinking at that moment?)
4. Utilize branches for bug and feature work

### Document
> “I don’t need comments, my code is self-documenting"

But it's better to make meaningful comment to explain why, not just what.

1. Comments are critical for future understanding
2. Good comments provide background and reasoning
3. Use descriptive variable and constant names
4. Include documentation

### Test (Unit Test)
1. Write unit tests
2. Run unit tests before committing code
3. Build a foundation for continuous integration

### Analyze
1. Simulate poor networks with Network Link Conditioner
2. Use sanitizers and checkers
3. Measure performance and efficiency with Debug Gauges
4. Investigate issues with Instruments

### Evaluate
1. Include code review as part of your practice

    No code would be used in practice until it has been code reviewed.
    
2. Understand each line
3. Build it
4. Run tests
5. Proofread for style, spelling, and syntax

### Decouple
1. Determine functional segments and break them out
2. Scale your work across multiple apps
3. Improve efficiency with extensions
4. Share your efforts with the broader community
5. Documentation is critical

### Manage
1. Use community and open source projects responsibly
2. Understand dependencies thoroughly
3. Ensure that privacy is respected
4. Have a plan if a dependency goes away or is no longer maintained
